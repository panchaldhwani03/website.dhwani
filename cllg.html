          <h3>Tasty and Healthy food</h3>
          <p>In American English, a college cafeteria caters to the culinary needs of college students, while in British English, it's commonly referred to as the refectory. These dining establishments can be housed within a residence hall or situated in a separate building. Many colleges enlist their students to work in these cafeterias. The number of meals provided to students varies from institution to institution, typically averaging around 21 meals per week. Similar to standard cafeterias, individuals typically use trays to select their desired food items, though at some campuses, payment is made in advance through the purchase of a meal plan.
